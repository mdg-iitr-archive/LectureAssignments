# Lecture Assignments

This respository will function as a one stop assignment portal for all the MDG lectures for 2016-2020 batch. Each lecture will be followed by an assignment which will be done and pushed in this repository.

### Before the first assignment
 - Install `git`.
 - Clone the repository using `git clone <repo_url>.git`.
 - Make sure you have `Android Studio` installed along with `Android SDK`.
 - Build the first project and install it on your mobile phone, thereby setting up adb.
 - Try wireless adb if you want.

### How to submit an assignment?
 - For the first assignment you need to make a branch with your `slack username` as the `branch name`.
 - For all subsequent assignemnts the same branch will be used and you will be adding commits to the branch.
 - Details for all the assignments will be provided in the lectures and a list will also be maintained here.
